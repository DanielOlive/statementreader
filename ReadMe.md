# Statement Reader

This project was created to help support the monitoring of personal account transactions. Features include importing csv data, filtering transactions and marking items as paid/complete. At present data can be imported from two providers American Express and Halifax bank, more to follow. A basic user authentication has been added for security purposes using JWT. This tool has been useful to me an ensures I deduct the correct amounts from other accounts.
